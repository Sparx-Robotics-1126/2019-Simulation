To use these properties which work for the 2019 robot, copy the two files properties.xml and tablesProperties.xml,
 and paste them into the data folder generated after the first run, deleting the properties.xml and tableProperties.xml
 files that existed there previously. If you do not see the folder, refresh your project.
